Passionate backend developer with a strong foundation in Go and Python, and a broad creative streak. After formal studies in software engineering, I honed my skills through hands-on work in backend development, DevOps, and cross-platform apps. A self-taught explorer in design, photography, and 3D, I thrive at the intersection of code and creativityâ€”always learning, always building.
<!-- Proven Software Platform Engineer with experience leveraging agile, DevOps, and CI/CD to manage large scale distributed platforms both on prem and in public cloud. -->

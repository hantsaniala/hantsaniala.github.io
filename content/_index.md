Passionate about the world of software development. After two years of studying software engineering,
I worked as a Golang, Python, VueJS and Flutter developer.
But at the same time, passionate about this world full of color, I studied several fields such as the world of graphic
design, photography, 3D as an autodidact and I always want to learn more and more.
All these years I affined my skills as a backend developer with Python and Golang.
<!-- Proven Software Platform Engineer with experience leveraging agile, DevOps, and CI/CD to manage large scale distributed platforms both on prem and in public cloud. -->

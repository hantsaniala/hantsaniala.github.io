kpz is a DevOps CLI toolkit designed to streamline local development workflows by automating the mapping of custom subdomains to local ports with HTTPS support. Written in Go, it leverages tools like mkcert and integrates with web servers such as Nginx or Apache2 to facilitate secure local development environments. This tool is particularly useful for developers who need to test applications with HTTPS locally, ensuring a development setup that closely mirrors production environments.
